The source files are sorted by name when added to ScriptBundle
or StyleBundle.

This can cause problems (e.g. jQuery must be included before scripts which ise it
or CSS @import directive must be first in CSS file).

Add the .ForceOrder() call to the ScriptBundle or StyleBundle
to force the order of source files in the minified file:

      bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jquery").Include(
                  "~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js").ForceOrder());
